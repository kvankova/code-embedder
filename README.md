## 📚 Description

This action looks for the following sections in the `README` file:
````md
 ```language:path/to/script
 ```
````
This action will update the code snippets in `README` files with the content of the script located at `path/to/script` and push the changes to the repository.

### 💡 Example

You will add the code block sections with path to the scripts in the following format:
````md
# README

This is a readme.

```python:main.py
```
````
The `main.py` file contains the following code:
```python
print("Embedding successful")
```

And once the worklow runs, the code block sections will be filled with the content of the script located at `main.py` and updated in the `README` file.

````md
# README

This is a readme.

```python:main.py
print("Embedding successful")
```
````
Once the content of the script located at `main.py` changes, the code block section will be updated in the `README` file with the next workflow run.

## 🔧 Setup
To use this action, you need to configure a yaml workflow file in `.github/workflows` folder (e.g. `.github/workflows/code-embedder.yaml`) with the following content:

```yaml
name: Code Embedder

on: pull_request

jobs:
  code_embedder:
    name: "Code embedder"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}

      - name: Run code embedder
        uses: kvankova/code-embedder@v0.2.0
        with:
          readme_paths: README.md README2.md
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```
You need to create a secret with write and repo permissions in the repository settings to pass it as `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the workflow.

You can specify which `README` files you want to update using the `readme_paths` input. This input accepts one or more paths to markdown files, separated by spaces. For example: `README.md README2.md`.

## 🔬 Under the hood
This action:
1. 📝 reads one or more `README` files from `readme_paths` input,
1. 🔍 looks for script paths in the `README`s,
1. 📄 reads the content of the scripts and embeds it in the `README`s at the corresponding locations,
1. 🚀 pushes the changes to the repository.
